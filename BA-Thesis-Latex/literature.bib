This paper presents the iterative, empirically based design of a robotic system that uses a computational model for identifying objects on the basis of a range of spatial reference systems. The efficiency of the system is evaluated by two successive empirical studies involving uninformed users. The linguistic analysis points to the striking variability in speakers' spontaneous strategies and preferences, and it motivates a number of modifications of the computational model.},

abstract = {Today’s mobile artificial agents, such as mobile robots, are based on an object-oriented paradigm. They partition their environment into various objects and act in relation to individual properties of these objects. Such perception and acting is insufficient for goal-directed behavior in dynamic environments, which requires action-relevant information in the form of affordances. Affordances describe action possibilities with respect to a specific agent. In this paper, we propose a functional model for affordance-based agents. This model integrates an adjusted version of the HIPE theory of function and an extended theory of affordances. We demonstrate the applicability of the functional model by relating it to two different cases of mobile robot interaction and outline an affordance-oriented robot architecture.},

To reach this aim, the robot needs to be equipped with the kind of knowledge that can be matched in a cognitively adequate way to users’ intuitive conceptual and linguistic preferences. Such an endeavour requires knowledge about human spatial object reference under consideration of object affordances and functional features. In this paper we motivate our approach by reviewing relevant insights gained in the field of Spatial Cognition, and we discuss the suitability of our robotic system to incorporate these findings. In our context, affordances are visually perceivable functional object aspects shared by the designer of the recognition module and the prospective robot user or instructor.},

For example, when dealing with relative directional relations, mereotopological relations may inherently be present without being directly expressed. We discuss how mereotopological relations may arise in constraint networks over Dipole relations and how these relations may be extracted via interdependency functions. Having made them explicit, these relations may be used to deploy reasoning methods specific to their spatial aspect. In order to further the development of Qualitative Spatial Reasoning, we present two families of benchmark problems that are cognitively easy to solve but still cannot be decided by present qualitative reasoning methods.},

So far it is known that the upper bound for the capacity of two-layer feedforward architectures with independent weights depends on the number of connections in the neural architecture [1].
In this paper we focus on the capacity of multilayer feedforward networks structured by shared weights. We show that these structured architectures can be transformed into equivalent conventional multilayer feed-forward architectures. Known estimations for the capacity are extended to achieve upper bounds for the capacity of these general multi-layer feedforward architectures. As a result an upper bound for the capacity of structured architectures is derived that increases with the number of independent network parameters. This means that weight sharing in a fixed neural architecture leads to a significant reduction of the upper bound of the capacity.},

abstract = {Non-intuitive styles of interaction between humans and mobile robots still constitute a major barrier to the wider application and acceptance of mobile robot technology. More natural interaction can only be achieved if ways are found of bridging the gap between the forms of spatialkno wledge maintained by such robots and the forms of language used by humans to communicate such knowledge. In this paper, we present the beginnings of a computationalmodelfor representing spatialkno wledge that is appropriate for interaction between humans and mobile robots. Work on spatial reference in human-human communication has established a range of reference systems adopted when referring to objects; we show the extent to which these strategies transfer to the human-robot situation and touch upon the problem of differing perceptual systems. Our results were obtained within an implemented kernel system which permitted the performance of experiments with human test subjects interacting with the system. We show how the results of the experiments can be used to improve the adequacy and the coverage of the system, and highlight necessary directions for future research.},

abstract = {With this contribution to the discussion about mental models we present a cognitive model for the understanding of speech and vision sensor data. The main point of this article is to explain the interaction between visual perception and language. The integration of language and vision is based on a theory of mental models in terms of which the integrative and coherent representation of objects, situations and events is crucial. The process of understanding does not only take place between adjacent processing levels, but interaction between visual components and language components on various processing levels is also important. Both aspects are crucial for cognitive modelling: The process of integrating sensor data into mental representations and the integration of various modalities.
As far as the experimental-simulative method in the area of cognitive science is concerned we are working on a simulation system. The basis of this system is a semantic network formalism which enables us to produce a uniform representation of different types of knowledge and a direct connection of a mental representation with sensor near levels. This system is being developed within the framework of a long term project called Collaborative Research Centre “Situated Artificial Communicators” (SFB 360) at Bielefeld University, Germany.11This research is funded by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) under grant SFB 360 - C3.},

We will follow the latter approach and provide a calculus for reasoning about point-like, linear and areal entities in geographic maps. The calculus consists of a constraint-based approach to the calculus-based method (CBM) in (Clementini et al., 1993). It is presented as an algebra alike to Allen’s (1983) temporal interval algebra. One advantage of presenting the CBM calculus in this way is that Allen’s incremental constraint propagation algorithm can then be used to reason about knowledge expressed in the calculus. The algorithm is guided by composition tables and a converse table provided in this contribution.},
