Our new approach has the advantage that we can generate prototypical shapes from our abstract representation in first-order predicate calculus. Using the conceptual neighborhood which is an established concept in QSR we can directly establish a conceptual neighborhood between shapes that translates into a similarity metric for shapes. We apply this similarity measure to a challenging computer vision problem and achieve promising first results.},

abstract = {In recent years, vehicle detection and classification have become essential tasks of intelligent transportation systems, and real-time, accurate vehicle detection from image and video data for traffic monitoring remains challenging. The most noteworthy challenges are real-time system operation to accurately locate and classify vehicles in traffic flows and working around total occlusions that hinder vehicle tracking. For real-time traffic monitoring, we present a traffic monitoring approach that overcomes the abovementioned challenges by employing convolutional neural networks that utilize You Only Look Once (YOLO). A real-time traffic monitoring system has been developed, and it has attracted significant attention from traffic management departments. Digitally processing and analyzing these videos in real time is crucial for extracting reliable data on traffic flow. Therefore, this study presents a real-time traffic monitoring system based on a virtual detection zone, Gaussian mixture model (GMM), and YOLO to increase the vehicle counting and classification efficiency. GMM and a virtual detection zone are used for vehicle counting, and YOLO is used to classify vehicles. Moreover, the distance and time traveled by a vehicle are used to estimate the speed of the vehicle. In this study, the Montevideo Audio and Video Dataset (MAVD), the GARM Road-Traffic Monitoring data set (GRAM-RTM), and our collection data sets are used to verify the proposed method. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method with YOLOv4 achieved the highest classification accuracy of 98.91\% and 99.5\% in MAVD and GRAM-RTM data sets, respectively. Moreover, the proposed method with YOLOv4 also achieves the highest classification accuracy of 99.1\%, 98.6\%, and 98\% in daytime, night time, and rainy day, respectively. In addition, the average absolute percentage error of vehicle speed estimation with the proposed method is about 7.6\%.},

abstract = {The growing population in large cities is creating traffic management issues. The metropolis road network management also requires constant monitoring, timely expansion, and modernization. In order to handle road traffic issues, an intelligent traffic management solution is required. Intelligent monitoring of traffic involves the detection and tracking of vehicles on roads and highways. There are various sensors for collecting motion information, such as transport video detectors, microwave radars, infrared sensors, ultrasonic sensors, passive acoustic sensors, and others. In this paper, we present an intelligent video surveillance-based vehicle tracking system. The proposed system uses a combination of the neural network, image-based tracking, and You Only Look Once (YOLOv3) to track vehicles. We train the proposed system with different datasets. Moreover, we use real video sequences of road traffic to test the performance of the proposed system. The evaluation outcomes showed that the proposed system can detect, track, and count the vehicles with acceptable results in changing scenarios.},

Any contour partition can be used, but the partitions obtained by discrete curve evolution (DCE) yield excellent results. The theoretical properties and the experiments presented demonstrate that obtained skeletons are in accord with human visual perception and stable, even in the presence of significant noise and shape variations, and have the same topology as the original skeletons. In particular, we have proven that the proposed approach never produces spurious branches, which are common when using the known skeleton pruning methods. Moreover, the proposed pruning method does not displace the skeleton points. Consequently, all skeleton points are centers of maximal disks. Again, many existing methods displace skeleton points in order to produces pruned skeletons},

abstract = {The automatic mapping of drainage networks from terrain representation has been an interesting topic in hydrological and geomorphological modeling. However, the existing methods often suffer from high sensitivity to terrain noise or lose significant stream branches and accurate channel paths. In this paper, we propose a contour-based framework in drainage network extraction. The proposed framework incorporates discrete curve evolution (DCE) to eliminate the noise influence by dynamically segmenting the contour lines (CLs) into valley bends, and to detect the valley feature points. The skeleton construction technique is then applied to distill more accurate channel paths in complex terrain. Finally, a linking step is undertaken to generate the channel network. The proposed method was tested on a series of elevation datasets, with varied resolution, region size, and local relief. The experiments verified that the proposed method can achieve highly accurate channel networks and is robust, even in regions with high-contrast relief, and/or in cases with significant terrain noise and irregularities.}

  abstract={The region clustering of a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image is more complicate than a computed topography (CT) image because a MRI image composes of three components such as Tl -weighted, T2-weighted, and proton density (PD) in each layer. However, the MRI images provide more detail than the CT images. Therefore, we propose a technique of the region clustering of MRI image by using fuzzy c-means (PCM). The fuzzy c-means algorithm is an iterative operation, that is very time-consuming and makes the algorithm impractical for using in image segmentation. To cope with this problem, the discrete curve evolution (DCE) technique is applied to find the actual cluster center to refine the initial value of the fuzzy c-means algorithm, which reduces the convergence time. In experimental results, the proposed technique provides the same segmentation accuracy as the fuzzy c-means technique. Moreover, this technique takes lower computational time comparing to the previous method.},

First, the employed method of discrete curve evolution developed for simplifying perceptual shape characteristics is explained. Specific problems of applying the method to cartographic data are elaborated. An algorithm is presented, which on the one hand simplifies spatial data up to a degree of abstraction intended by the user; and which on the other hand does not violate local spatial ordering between (elements of) cartographic entities, since local arrangement of entities is assumed to be an important spatial knowledge characteristic. The operation of the implemented method is demonstrated using two different examples of cartographic data.},

% abstract = {Many applications utilizing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) require the use of computer vision algorithms to analyze the information captured from their on-board camera. Recent advances in deep learning have made it possible to use single-shot Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) detection algorithms that process the input image to detect various objects of interest. To keep the computational demands low these neural networks typically operate on small image sizes which, however, makes it difficult to detect small objects. This is further emphasized when considering UAVs equipped with cameras where due to the viewing range, objects tend to appear relatively small. This paper therefore, explores the trade-offs involved when maintaining the resolution of the objects of interest by extracting smaller patches (tiles) from the larger input image and processing them using a neural network. Specifically, we introduce an attention mechanism to focus on detecting objects only in some of the tiles and a memory mechanism to keep track of information for tiles that are not processed. Through the analysis of different methods and experiments we show that by carefully selecting which tiles to process we can considerably improve the detection accuracy while maintaining comparable performance to CNNs that resize and process a single image which makes the proposed approach suitable for UAV applications.},

We describe a rule-based algorithm for robust facial expression recognition combined with robust face detection using a convolutional neural network. In this study, we address the problem of subject independence as well as translation, rotation, and scale invariance in the recognition of facial expression. The result shows reliable detection of smiles with recognition rate of 97.6 Percent for 5600 still images of more than 10 subjects. The proposed algorithm demonstrated the ability to discriminate smiling from talking based on the saliency score obtained from voting visual cues. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first facial expression recognition model with the property of subject independence combined with robustness to variability in facial appearance. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

These biologically inspired computational models can far exceed the per- performance of previous forms of artificial intelligence in common machine-learning tasks. One of the most impressive forms of ANN architecture is that of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). CNNs are primarily used to solve difficult image-driven pattern recognition tasks and with their precise yet simple architecture, offer a simplified method of getting started with ANNs. This document briefly introduces CNNs, discussing recently published papers and newly formed techniques in developing this bill- leniently fantastic image recognition models. This introduction assumes you are familiar with ANNs and machine learning fundamentals.},

abstract = {We present a method for training CNN-based object class detectors directly using mean average precision (mAP) as the training loss, in a truly end-to-end fashion that includes non-maximum suppresion (NMS) at training time. This contrasts with the traditional approach of training a CNN for a window classification loss, then applying NMS only at test time, when mAP is used as the evaluation metric in place of classification accuracy. However, mAP following NMS forms a piecewise-constant structured loss over thousands of windows, with gradients that do not convey useful information for gradient descent. Hence, we define new, general gradient-like quantities for piecewise constant functions, which have wide applicability. We describe how to calculate these efficiently for mAP following NMS, enabling to train a detector based on Fast R-CNN [1] directly for mAP. This model achieves equivalent performance to the standard Fast R-CNN on the PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 datasets, while being conceptually more appealing as the very same model and loss are used at both training and test time.},

abstract = {Intersection over Union (IoU) is the most popular evaluation metric used in the object detection benchmarks. However, there is a gap between optimizing the commonly used distance losses for regressing the parameters of a bounding box and maximizing this metric value. The optimal objective for a metric is the metric itself. In the case of axis-aligned 2D bounding boxes, it can be shown that IoU can be directly used as a regression loss. However, IoU has a plateau making it infeasible to optimize in the case of non-overlapping bounding boxes. In this paper, we address the this weakness by introducing a generalized version of IoU as both a new loss and a new metric. By incorporating this generalized IoU ( GIoU) as a loss into the state-of-the art object detection frameworks, we show a consistent improvement on their performance using both the standard, IoU based, and new, GIoU based, performance measures on popular object detection benchmarks such as PASCAL VOC and MS COCO.},

abstract = {Bounding box regression is the crucial step in object detection. In existing methods, while ℓn-norm loss is widely adopted for bounding box regression, it is not tailored to the evaluation metric, i.e., Intersection over Union (IoU). Recently, IoU loss and generalized IoU (GIoU) loss have been proposed to benefit the IoU metric, but still suffer from the problems of slow convergence and inaccurate regression. In this paper, we propose a Distance-IoU (DIoU) loss by incorporating the normalized distance between the predicted box and the target box, which converges much faster in training than IoU and GIoU losses. Furthermore, this paper summarizes three geometric factors in bounding box regression, i.e., overlap area, central point distance and aspect ratio, based on which a Complete IoU (CIoU) loss is proposed, thereby leading to faster convergence and better performance. By incorporating DIoU and CIoU losses into state-of-the-art object detection algorithms, e.g., YOLO v3, SSD and Faster R-CNN, we achieve notable performance gains in terms of not only IoU metric but also GIoU metric. Moreover, DIoU can be easily adopted into non-maximum suppression (NMS) to act as the criterion, further boosting performance improvement.},

@article{Li2020,
abstract = {One-stage detector basically formulates object detection as dense classification and localization (i.e., bounding box regression). The classification is usually optimized by Focal Loss and the box location is commonly learned under Dirac delta distribution. A recent trend for one-stage detectors is to introduce an individual prediction branch to estimate the quality of localization, where the predicted quality facilitates the classification to improve detection performance. This paper delves into the representations of the above three fundamental elements: quality estimation, classification and localization. Two problems are discovered in existing practices, including (1) the inconsistent usage of the quality estimation and classification between training and inference, and (2) the inflexible Dirac delta distribution for localization. To address the problems, we design new representations for these elements. Specifically, we merge the quality estimation into the class prediction vector to form a joint representation, and use a vector to represent arbitrary distribution of box locations. The improved representations eliminate the inconsistency risk and accurately depict the flexible distribution in real data, but contain continuous labels, which is beyond the scope of Focal Loss. We then propose Generalized Focal Loss (GFL) that generalizes Focal Loss from its discrete form to the continuous version for successful optimization. On COCO test-dev, GFL achieves 45.0 Percent AP using ResNet-101 backbone, surpassing state-of-the-art SAPD (43.5 Percent) and ATSS (43.6 Percent) with higher or comparable inference speed.},

At the same time, it is a high-level programming language that supports multi programming paradigms such as imperative, functional, and object-oriented. Therefore, by default, it is almost obvious to believe that Python is also the appropriate language for teaching parallel programming paradigms. This paper presents an in-depth study that examines to what extent Python language is suitable for teaching parallel programming to inexperienced students. The findings show that Python has stumbling blocks that prevent it from preserving its advantages when shifting from serial programming to parallel programming. Therefore, choosing Python as the first language for teaching parallel programming calls for strong justifications, especially when better solutions exist in the community.},

@article{Latecki2003,
abstract = {Human perception of shape is based on visual parts of objects to a point that a single, significant visual part is sufficient to recognize the whole object. For example, if you see a hand in the door, you expect a human behind the door. Therefore, a cognitively motivated shape similarity measure for recognition applications should be based on visual parts. This cognitive assumption leads to two related problems of scale selection and subpart selection. To find a given query part Q as part of an object C, Q needs to have a correct size with regards to C (scale selection). Assuming that the correct size is selected, the part Q must be compared to all possible subparts of C (subpart selection). For global, contour-based similarity measures, scaling the whole contour curves of both objects to the same length usually solves the problem of scale selection. Although this is not an optimal solution, it works if the whole contour curves are 'sufficiently' similar. Subpart selection problem does not occur in the implementation of global similarity measures. In this paper we present a shape similarity system that is based on correspondence of visual parts, and apply it to robot localization and mapping. This is a particularly interesting application, since the scale selection problem does not occur here and visual parts can be obtained in a very simple way. Therefore, only the problem of subpart selection needs to be solved. Our solution to this problem is based on a contour based shape similarity measure supplemented by a structural arrangement information of visual parts. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.},

The de facto standard NMS algorithm is still fully hand-crafted, suspiciously simple, and - being based on greedy clustering with a fixed distance threshold - forces a trade-off between recall and precision. We propose a new network architecture designed to perform NMS, using only boxes and their score.

@article{Ren2017,
abstract = {Most object detectors contain two important components: a feature extractor and an object classifier. The feature extractor has rapidly evolved with significant research efforts leading to better deep convolutional architectures. The object classifier, however, has not received much attention and many recent systems (like SPPnet and Fast/Faster R-CNN) use simple multi-layer perceptrons. This paper demonstrates that carefully designing deep networks for object classification is just as important. We experiment with region-wise classifier networks that use shared, region-independent convolutional features. We call them 'Networks on Convolutional feature maps' (NoCs). We discover that aside from deep feature maps, a deep and convolutional per-region classifier is of particular importance for object detection, whereas latest superior image classification models (such as ResNets and GoogLeNets) do not directly lead to good detection accuracy without using such a per-region classifier. We show by experiments that despite the effective ResNets and Faster R-CNN systems, the design of NoCs is an essential element for the 1st-place winning entries in ImageNet and MS COCO challenges 2015.},
