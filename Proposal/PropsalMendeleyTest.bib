abstract = {We concentrate here on decomposition of 2D objects into meaningfulparts of visual form, orvisual parts. It is a simple observation that convex parts of objects determine visual parts. However, the problem is that many significant visual parts are not convex, since a visual part may have concavities. We solve this problem by identifying convex parts at different stages of a proposed contour evolution method in which significant visual parts will become convex object parts at higher stages of the evolution. We obtain a novel rule for decomposition of 2D objects into visual parts, called the hierarchical convexity rule, which states that visual parts are enclosed by maximal convex (with respect to the object) boundary arcs at different stages of the contour evolution. This rule determines not only parts of boundary curves but directly the visual parts of objects. Moreover, the stages of the evolution hierarchy induce a hierarchical structure of the visual parts. The more advanced the stage of contour evolution, the more significant is the shape contribution of the obtained visual parts. {\textcopyright} 1999 Academic Press.},

abstract = {The modeling of concepts from a cognitive perspective is important for designing spatial information systems that interoperate with human users. Concept representations that are built using geometric and topological conceptual space structures are well suited for semantic similarity and concept combination operations. In addition, concepts that are more closely grounded in the physical world, such as many spatial concepts, have a natural fit with the geometric structure of conceptual spaces. Despite these apparent advantages, conceptual spaces are underutilized because existing formalizations of conceptual space theory have focused on individual aspects of the theory rather than the creation of a comprehensive algebra. In this paper we present a metric conceptual space algebra that is designed to facilitate the creation of conceptual space knowledge bases and inferencing systems. Conceptual regions are represented as convex polytopes and context is built in as a fundamental element. We demonstrate the applicability of the algebra to spatial information systems with a proof-of-concept application. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {We propose a simple approach to evolution of polygonal curves that is specially designed to fit discrete nature of curves in digital images. It leads to simplification of shape complexity with no blurring (i.e., shape rounding) effects and no dislocation of relevant features. Moreover, in our approach the problem to determine the size of discrete steps for numerical implementations does not occur, since our evolution method leads in a natural way to a finite number of discrete evolution steps which are just the iterations of a basic procedure of vertex deletion.},
