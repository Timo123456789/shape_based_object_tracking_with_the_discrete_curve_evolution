	abstract     = {The motivation for using qualitative shape descriptions is as follows: qualitative shape descriptions can implicitly act as a schema for measuring the similarity of shapes, which has the potential to be cognitively adequate. Then, shapes which are similar to each other would also be similar for a pattern recognition algorithm. There is substantial work in pattern recognition and computer vision dealing with shape similarity. Here with our approach to qualitative shape descriptions and shape similarity, the focus is on achieving a representation using only simple predicates that a human could even apply without computer support.},

	abstract     = {Shape simplification in map-like representations is used for two reasons: either to abstract from irrelevant detail to reduce a map user's cognitive load, or to simplify information when a map of a smaller scale is derived from a detailed reference map. We present a method for abstracting simplified cartographic representations from more accurate spatial data. First, the employed method of discrete curve evolution developed for simplifying perceptual shape characteristics is explained. Specific problems of applying the method to cartographic data are elaborated. An algorithm is presented, which on the one hand simplifies spatial data up to a degree of abstraction intended by the user; and which on the other hand does not violate local spatial ordering between (elements of) cartographic entities, since local arrangement of entities is assumed to be an important spatial knowledge characteristic. The operation of the implemented method is demonstrated using two different examples of cartographic data.},

	abstract     = {We concentrate here on decomposition of 2D objects into meaningfulparts of visual form, orvisual parts. It is a simple observation that convex parts of objects determine visual parts. However, the problem is that many significant visual parts are not convex, since a visual part may have concavities. We solve this problem by identifying convex parts at different stages of a proposed contour evolution method in which significant visual parts will become convex object parts at higher stages of the evolution. We obtain a novel rule for decomposition of 2D objects into visual parts, called the hierarchical convexity rule, which states that visual parts are enclosed by maximal convex (with respect to the object) boundary arcs at different stages of the contour evolution. This rule determines not only parts of boundary curves but directly the visual parts of objects. Moreover, the stages of the evolution hierarchy induce a hierarchical structure of the visual parts. The more advanced the stage of contour evolution, the more significant is the shape contribution of the obtained visual parts. {\textcopyright} 1999 Academic Press.},

abstract = {A nonparametric and unsupervised method of automatic threshold selection for picture segmentation is presented. An optimal threshold is selected by the discriminant criterion, namely, so as to maximize the separability of the resultant classes in gray levels. The procedure is very simple, utilizing only the zeroth- and the first-order cumulative moments of the gray-level histogram. It is straightforward to extend the method to multithreshold problems. Several experimental results are also presented to support the validity of the method.},

@article{Plastiras2018,
abstract = {Many applications utilizing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) require the use of computer vision algorithms to analyze the information captured from their on-board camera. Recent advances in deep learning have made it possible to use single-shot Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) detection algorithms that process the input image to detect various objects of interest. To keep the computational demands low these neural networks typically operate on small image sizes which, however, makes it difficult to detect small objects. This is further emphasized when considering UAVs equipped with cameras where due to the viewing range, objects tend to appear relatively small. This paper therefore, explores the trade-offs involved when maintaining the resolution of the objects of interest by extracting smaller patches (tiles) from the larger input image and processing them using a neural network. Specifically, we introduce an attention mechanism to focus on detecting objects only in some of the tiles and a memory mechanism to keep track of information for tiles that are not processed. Through the analysis of different methods and experiments we show that by carefully selecting which tiles to process we can considerably improve the detection accuracy while maintaining comparable performance to CNNs that resize and process a single image which makes the proposed approach suitable for UAV applications.},
